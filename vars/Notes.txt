under dockerBuild.groovy
def call (String project, String ImageTag, String hubUser ){
    sh """
        docker image build -t ${hubUser}/${project} .
        docker image tag ${hubUser}/${project} ${hubUser}/${project}:${ImageTag}
        docker image tag ${hubUser}/${project} ${hubUser}/${project}:latest

    """
}
- in the def call function we are building the image and tagging it with the ImageTag and latest tag
- but in the parameters we are passing the first parameter as project 
and in the sh file first line 
it will take the project as hubUser
- and hubUser as the third parameter we need to change the value in the jenkinsfile, previously it was AppName, we changed that to hubUser
